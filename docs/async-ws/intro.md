# async-ws

`@culpeo/async-ws` is a cross-platform WebSocket client that turns the event-driven WebSocket API into a small, imperative, promise-based interface.

## Key features

- Works in both Node.js and browsers from one package
- Promise-based `connect()`, `send()`, `receive()`, and `close()` APIs
- Async iteration support with `for await...of`
- Message buffering for messages that arrive before `receive()` is called
- Configurable `maxBufferSize` with oldest-message eviction when full
- Connect timeout and `AbortSignal` support
- Keep-alive with automatic ping/pong (Node.js)
- Server-side socket adoption with `fromSocket()` (Node.js)
- TypeScript-first with bundled type definitions
